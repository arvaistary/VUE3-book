## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md
- UIPLAN = FEATURE_DIR/ui-plan.md (optional; if absent — skip the UI passes)

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From Hybrid v2 contract sections (when present):**

- Workflow contract declarations, mutation inventory, authorization matrix and
  coverage, server-controlled fields, privacy boundary, side-effect and
  concurrency evidence.
- `CONTRACT_RECONCILIATION` and `AUTH_MATRIX_ROW_COVERAGE` declarations, if
  present; these are stricter checks for new high-risk work items.

**From ui-plan.md (if present):**

- Screen overview (SCR-###), states (ST-###), interactions (IX-###), test matrix, Constitution Check (sections A and B)
- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-ui-plan.sh --json <UIPLAN>` — include any section-A integrity violations in the report

**From durable UI memory (only if ui-plan.md present):**

- Load `.specify/memory/ui/screens.md` — the durable screen registry (`SCREEN-<slug>` IDs + the Archetype column). Required by the UI-Plan detection pass (step 4, §G → "Durable consistency"): each CHANGED screen must resolve to a `SCREEN-<slug>` that actually exists here, and its archetype must match this registry. Without this load that check has no data and would be silently skipped or guessed.

**From constitution:**

- Load `/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements
- **UI inventory** (if ui-plan.md present): SCR-###/ST-###/IX-### keys bound to stories and requirements; test-matrix rows. Extend the task coverage mapping by matching ST-/IX- → test tasks in tasks.md.

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

#### H. Contract/source-of-truth reconciliation (Hybrid v2)

When the spec declares `CONTRACT_RECONCILIATION: required`, reconcile every
workflow-, security-, privacy- and side-effect-sensitive claim across this
chain:

```text
spec.md → plan.md/tasks.md → API/schema/docs → implementation target → named test → evidence
```

- Check that the exact negative outcome, precedence, state predicate and
  ownership exception are identical across artifacts; a broad "participant"
  row or class-level test name is not proof of every actor branch.
- Flag claims that have no named assertion, claims whose test task covers a
  different actor/endpoint, and claims where API/schema/docs disagree with the
  canonical spec.
- Check that `AUTH_MATRIX_ROW_COVERAGE: required` has a bidirectional
  matrix-row ↔ stable-case-ID mapping, not merely a separate list of tests.
- Treat any unresolved mismatch as HIGH or CRITICAL according to its security
  or workflow impact and recommend repair before `/speckit.implement`.

#### G. UI Plan (only if ui-plan.md is present)

- **Constitution compliance**: each row of ui-plan.md section B cites a canon that actually exists in the constitution (ID and name match); an unclosed gate or an invented canon = CRITICAL. An N/A mark is valid only if the constitution really is unfilled (ALL_CAPS placeholders remain) — but in that case raise the unfilled constitution itself as a finding, exactly like the stock "unresolved placeholders" pass, severity per the general rules; do not silently skip it. Intentionally deferred, explicitly justified constitution slots are not findings.
- **Coverage gaps**: if a TDD policy is in effect (tests requested or mandated by a canon), every ST-### and IX-### in ui-plan.md has a test task in tasks.md, and every test-matrix row is reflected in tasks. Without a TDD policy, the absence of test tasks is not a finding.
- **Inconsistency**: the screen states in ui-plan.md match the behavior/states from spec.md (the "what" is not overridden; in lite — the work-item description); screens and routes do not contradict plan.md; terminology is consistent across artifacts.
- **Traceability**: the Source of each ST-###/IX-### marked US-###/FR-###/§spec actually exists in spec.md; an invented reference = finding. The clarify/UI-mechanic labels are allowed without a spec reference.
- **Durable consistency**: each SCR marked CHANGED references a SCREEN-<slug> that actually exists in ui/screens.md; a NEW screen is not yet there (finalize will add it). The archetype in "Screen Overview" matches the registry for CHANGED.

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Contract/source-of-truth reconciliation:**

| Claim | Canonical outcome | Named proof | Artifact consistency | Status |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| … | … | … | … | Clear / Finding |

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /speckit.specify with refinement", "Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)
